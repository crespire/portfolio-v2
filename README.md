# Portfolio V2

I think I'm going to try Bridgetown. I had thoughts about sticking with Jekyll, but I think as Ruby advances beyond 3.0, a lot of the Jekyll plugins I might be interested in will age out of the ecosystem without any active maintainers, and I am not super keen to maintain a bunch of old/broken Ruby code for a simple site like a portfolio static site.
