I'm a full stack Rails developer who is driven and independent with a high aptitude for learning. I strive for excellence while building software, and try to stay humble. I'm a great communicator around technical topics and love teaching and talking about tech.

I'm one of the co-hosts for [Toronto Ruby](https://toronto-ruby.com/). If you're local, we'd love to see you!
