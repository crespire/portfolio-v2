This project was the capstone for the full Odin Project course which culminated in a Typescrit React powered frontend with ReactQuery interfacing with a Rails 7 API.  

This project was the final exploration of the bifurcated client/API architecture and featured my most extensive React application to date. The frontend application relied on ReactQuery to maintain data consistency with the backend.  

I also delivered this project with a suite of tests powered by Cypress for fully end to end tested user interaction paths. Cypress was engaging to use and I found it very analogous to Capybara. The testing ultimately could be improved, as they involve a lot of mocked API calls, rather than fully end to end, I was happy enough with the toy project to ship it.  

Overall, as a learning experience, I found this project very fruitful and have noted future opportunities in the repository README which might be worthwhile to take on.
