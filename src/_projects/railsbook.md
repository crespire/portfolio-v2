Railsbook was the capstone to the Rails course in The Odin Project's curriculum and was the first big application I wrote using the framework. There were many triumphs including actively developing a custom CSS for the application using the BEM methodology, diving in to figuring out many staple Rails ecosystem gems like Devise, Omniauth and Hotwire/Turbo/Stimulus.  

I'm extremely proud of the total effort this project represents, from building the application and using some new-to-me techniques like nested resources, controller concerns and custom validators, to building a full Rspec suite in the context of Rails for the first time using gems like Faker, FactoryBot and Capybara. This project touched on all the major areas of typical Rails application development and the result was something I was quite happy with.  

I also learned a lot about deployments and setting up environments via this project. I initially deployed the project via Heroku's free tier but later moved the project to my own VPS with dokku. I learned lessons each time I had to move the project, and continue to revisit it here and there to remind me just how far I've come.  

Like my other personal learning journey projects, Railsbook does have some pending improvements for me to tackle outlined in the repository.
