I am very excited to write this because it's been something I've been thinking about doing since I started my professional journey with Ruby and Rails.

As I've entered the industry, one thing that's become crystal clear is that a community can take you very far in your journey, whether you're learning or working. Community and culture go hand in hand and both are such integral parts of sustained and happy professional growth.

Without a community, it can be hard to grow. New techniques or ideas may not come across your desk as much, you might also feel the burden of problems alone which can contribute to burnout. You may not have an outlet to share your questions, passions and challenges.

Community can be one major way to sustain happiness in your craft, and there's nothing like in person meetups to build community! As a new Ruby dev, I was very disheartened to learn that the local Toronto Ruby community was... well, inactive.

I was so eager to connect with folks who loved and used Ruby every day. The language is still alive and well, but I felt alone and a little bit lost. So, I dreamed big and thought about how I could be the change I wanted to see and try to revive the Ruby scene in the GTA. We're here and we love Ruby, _still_. Yes, in 2023!

I'm fortunate enough to have found a few like-minded folks that have the same vision. As a result, I am happy to say we've set up shop at [https://toronto-ruby.com](https://toronto-ruby.com) which is currently a landing page to build a list of folks who are interested to hear from us about upcoming events. We have a few things in the works, so please stay tuned!

Our vision is to provide a place for the GTA Ruby community to flourish, learn and grow together; be a place where folks can make friends and find others that love Ruby!

I'm really looking forward to seeing where this goes, and I hope you'll consider joining us on this journey.
