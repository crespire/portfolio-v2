# &#128075; Hi, I'm Simmon Li!
<small>(pronounced Simon)</small>

I'm a budding full stack Rails developer.

Driven and independent with a high aptitude for learning, I strive for excellence while building software. I'm a great communicator around technical topics and love teaching and talking about tech.
